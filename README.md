* You must implement the save, update and delete methods in both models and make sure you write tests for each method

* When a user clicks on an Image he/she should be redirected where a larger version of the image is displayed and should also see the details of the Image.
* A user should be able to click a button and have the link to the image copied to the machineâ€™s clipboard. Make sure you write a test for this functionality.
* Your project should have a dashboard that you will use to post photos to the database and manage the photos.
